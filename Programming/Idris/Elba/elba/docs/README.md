# The elba Guide

"The elba Guide" is intended to be exactly what it says on the tin: a
user-facing guide for using `elba` for day-to-day development tasks and
understanding its functionality.

The guide is available online at [Read the Docs](https://elba.readthedocs.io).

## Building

The guide is built using Sphinx. After installing that, building the
book is as simple as:

```sh
# On Unix:
$ make
# On Windows:
$ make.bat
```

The book will be in the `build` directory, with the index at
`build/index.html`.
