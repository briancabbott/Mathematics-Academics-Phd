stg interpreter state:
  stack
    unboxed tuples
    stack frame = local binders
    let no escape??
  heap
    stg heap objects?
    data constructor
    closure object
    app node

NOTE:
  only the heap objects are tagged at run-time, atom type observation is not allowed during evaluation! ; use the reptype instead.

READ:
  - Apply.cmm
  - StgStdThunks.cmm

Q: only case forces heap objects?? what about apply? it must progress PAPS and thunks
A: App can force also

Q: what is the semantic of StgApp?
A: (zero arg = StgVar)
   forces saturated closures, stores args otherwise

Q: are all thunks created at compile time, can a thunk be created at runtime?
A: StgLet is the only source of thunks

Q: can any heap object turn into a thunk?
A: no, apply always forces if the closure gets saturated


TODO:
  - refresh unique values to generate globally unique ones
  - compile dynlib version of package .cbits

IDEA:
  Implementation method:
    first:  pure and simple haskell
    then:   gradually optimize if necessary

Q: what is coercionToken# ?
A: it has VoidRep, it is compiled from coercions. disappears at runtime,
   needed to model arity correctly and prevent early closure saturation

use cases:
  use the interpreter as:
    debugger
    heap visualizer in the browser ; send the state as a json
    concolic execution ; concrete and abstract checking strictness or liveness or lifetime, or validate the analysis
    check new memory management methods
    create ghc typed runtime system model ; synthetize a native implementation in a strictly typed system such as ATS
    interpreter as jit compiler ; either typed x86 jit EDSL or luajit or javascript jit or llvmjit
    on the fly origin tracking ; stop program and check everything on the source code
    maybe the native backend should be automatically calculated from interpreter and not written from scratch at all??
