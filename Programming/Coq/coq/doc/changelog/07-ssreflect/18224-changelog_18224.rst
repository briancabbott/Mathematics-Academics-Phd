- **Changed:**
  ssreflect no longer relies on the recovery mechanism
  of the parsing engine, this can slightly change
  the parsing priorities in rare occurences, for instance
  when combining :tacn:`unshelve` and ``=>``
  (`#18224 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/18224>`_,
  by Pierre Roux).
- **Changed:**
  notations ``_.1`` and ``_.2`` are now defined in the prelude
  at level 1 rather than in ``ssrfun`` at level 2
  (`#18224 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/18224>`_,
  by Pierre Roux).
